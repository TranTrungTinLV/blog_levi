                            <p>There was a boy named Shoya who had bullied a deaf girl named Shoko in elementary school. Years later, haunted by his past, Shoya tries to make amends and befriends Shoko, hoping to show her that he has changed.

                                As they spend time together, Shoya begins to develop feelings for Shoko. He knows that she cannot hear his voice, but he still wants to tell her how he feels, hoping that his actions will speak louder than words.

                                One spring day, Shoko and Shoya are waiting for the bus to take them to school. As they stand in silence, Shoya's heart beats faster and faster, knowing that this might be his chance to confess his love.

                                As the bus pulls up, Shoya turns to Shoko and signs, "I love you."</p>

                            <p>But before Shoko can respond, the bus driver honks the horn, signaling that it's time to board.

                                As they ride the bus to school, Shoya watches Shoko, hoping to see some sign that she feels the same way. But Shoko remains quiet, lost in her own thoughts.

                                Days turned into weeks, and Shoya never had the chance to tell Shoko how he felt again. Eventually, Shoko had to move away, leaving Shoya to wonder what could have been.</p>
