After gaining a solid foundation in Python, I decided to explore other programming languages. In 2021, I started learning C++, a powerful language used in a wide range of applications, from video games to operating systems.

```c
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  // declaring and assigning a variable
  int x = 10;

  // printing the variable
  cout << x << endl;

  // declaring an array and accessing its elements
  int my_array[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
  cout << my_array[2] << endl;

  // declaring a function that takes in two parameters and returns their sum
  int add_numbers(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
  }

  // calling the function and printing the result
  int result = add_numbers(3, 5);
  cout << result << endl;

  // declaring a class and creating an instance of it
  class Person {
    public:
      string name;
      int age;
  };

  Person person1;
  person1.name = "John";
  person1.age = 25;
  cout << person1.name << endl;

  return 0;
}

```

This code includes the iostream library and declares a main function, which declares a variable x and prints its value, declares an array my_array and prints the third element, declares a function add_numbers that takes in two parameters and returns their sum, calls the function and prints the result, declares a class Person with a public name and age variable, creates an instance of the class, assigns values to its variables, and prints the person's name. These are some of the basic concepts of C++ programming. Very boring!
